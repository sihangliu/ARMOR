I am assuming Microsoft Excel is available in your system.

bound.xlsx -> The latest results can be found in sheet "new"
dram_power.xlsx -> Sheet1 is the basic DRAM power from Micron's calculator
                   Sheet2 is the results of the MICRO submission which does not consider reshuffle units
                   Sheet "new_power(latest)" is the results used in the ASPLOS submission
